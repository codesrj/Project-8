# Project-8
EIGHT is a Personal Digital Assistant which can answer most of your questions using Wolframalpha and Wikipedia.

EIGHT is completely written in Python. It uses "SpeechRecognition" library for processing speech with the help of Googleâ€™s free web search API "Google Recognizer".
After successful recognition, it processes the question and looks for the answer on Wolframalpha and Wikipedia. The answer is read aloud to the user with the help of Microsoft Text to Speech engine on Windows.

For now, EIGHT can describe itself, open Webpages and look for answers on Wolframalpha and Wikipedia.
